# Function-Approximation-by-Genetic-Algorithm
 One of the issues raised in mathematical and engineering sciences is the ap
proximation of a function. Function approximation means that, by having
 the ability to calculate the value of an unknown function at arbitrary points,
 the mathematical rule of the said function is approximated. In this assign
ment, genetic programming (GP) is used for the function approximation.
 One of the applications of GP is function approximation. In this applica
tion, each individual in the population represents a mathematical expression
 depicted as a tree. The internal nodes of this tree consist of mathematical,
 logical, or any user-defined operators, while the leaf nodes of the tree con
tain constant values and input variables. The goal of this application is to
 approximate the mathematical formula of an objective function. The objec
tive function is considered a black box, and the only information known (or
 obtainable) is obtaining the value of the function at arbitrary points.
 In this way, we obtain the values of the function at several arbitrary points
 and use them as a training set. For each tree, based on the values obtained
 for the training points, and the value of difference from the actual values, a
 f
 itness value can be assigned. Based on this fitness value, an evolutionary
 algorithm is then followed.
 The operators used in the trees should include at least the following (you can
 also add more items):
 • Binary operators include: + (addition),- (subtraction), * (multiplica
tion), / (division), and ˆ (power).
 • Unary operators include: cos(x), sin(x).
 An example of a tree:
    y =2π+((x+3)− 1/sin(x))

Inputs:
Several training points along with the corresponding output values of the target function at those points are considered. For simplicity, a one-dimensional function is assumed.

Outputs:
 Display of the formula corresponding to the best tree generated by the algorithm, the fitness value of the best tree, the number of generations, the number of fitness evaluations, and the execution time.
